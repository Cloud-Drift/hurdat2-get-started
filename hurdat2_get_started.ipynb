Simply put, the HURDAT2 dataset is a dataset that contains storm track data (including other measurements such as pressure, wind speed, etc...) for storms recorded from 1852 - 2022 across both the pacific and atlantic ocean.\n",

As an example say you wanted a subset of the dataset for storms whose track lied within the atlantic basin and was tracked between August and October of 2020. You can leverage the `subset` function by first defining the criteria:"
