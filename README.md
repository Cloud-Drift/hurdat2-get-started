# hurdat2-get-started
This repository contains notebooks to get you started with the [HURDAT2 dataset](https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/Data_Storm.html) using python and the [*xarray* library](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/). 

These notebooks should be readily executable in a binder environment which can be launched by clicking the "launch binder" badge above :point_up:. Alternatively, you can run locally the notebooks in a python environment containing the python libraries listed in the file `environment.yml`.

Feel free to contribute to this repo or raise an issue!
